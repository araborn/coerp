                <p>  The <em>Corpus of English Religious Prose</em> is a diachronic, multi-genre corpus which, in its present outline, covers English religious prose from 1150 to the end of the eighteenth century. It is designed to reflect both continuity and change of English writing in one of its most important domains with emphasis on innovation, transformation, and loss in genres. It is suited to meet the needs of both long-term diachronic studies as well as synchronic studies, particularly from a pragmatic, text-linguistic perspective and with a special interest in the history of individual genres. </p>
